# Problem 1

Read in the dataset:

```{r}
data("instacart")
instacart=instacart
```

Description of dataset:
This dataset has `r nrow(instacart)` rows and `r ncol(instacart)` columns,  with each row resprenting a single product from an instacart order. 
Variables include:
`order_id`: order identifier
`product_id`: product identifier
`add_to_cart_order`: the order in which each product was added to the cart
`reordered`: 1 if this prodcut has been ordered by this user in the past, 0 otherwise
`user_id`: customer identifier
`eval_set`: which evaluation set this order belongs in (Note that the data for use in this class is exclusively from the “train” eval_set)
`order_number`: the order sequence number for this user (1=first, n=nth)
`order_dow`: the day of the week on which the order was placed
`order_hour_of_day`: the hour of the day on which the order was placed
`days_since_prior_order`: days since the last order, capped at 30, NA if order_number=1
product_name: name of the product
`aisle_id`: aisle identifier
`department_id`: department identifier
`aisle`: the name of the aisle
`department`: the name of the department

The number of aisles and which aisles are the most items ordered from:
```{r}
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```
There are `r n_distinct(instacart$aisle)` aisles. The most item are ordered from fresh vegetables aisles.
