# Problem 1 (Instacart)

Read in the dataset:

``` r
data("instacart")
instacart=instacart
```

Description of dataset: This dataset has 1384617 rows and 15 columns,
with each row resprenting a single product from an instacart order.
Variables include: `order_id`: order identifier `product_id`: product
identifier `add_to_cart_order`: the order in which each product was
added to the cart `reordered`: 1 if this prodcut has been ordered by
this user in the past, 0 otherwise `user_id`: customer identifier
`eval_set`: which evaluation set this order belongs in (Note that the
data for use in this class is exclusively from the “train” eval_set)
`order_number`: the order sequence number for this user (1=first, n=nth)
`order_dow`: the day of the week on which the order was placed
`order_hour_of_day`: the hour of the day on which the order was placed
`days_since_prior_order`: days since the last order, capped at 30, NA if
order_number=1 product_name: name of the product `aisle_id`: aisle
identifier `department_id`: department identifier `aisle`: the name of
the aisle `department`: the name of the department

The number of aisles and which aisles are the most items ordered from:

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n

    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

There are 134 aisles. The most item are ordered from fresh vegetables
aisles.

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  filter(n > 10000) |> 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()  
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week.

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

# Problem 2 (BRFSS)

Load the data data from the p8105.datasets package using:

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
brfss=brfss_smart2010
```

Data cleaning:

format the data to use appropriate variable names; focus on the “Overall
Health” topic include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor” organize
responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”

Specify response column (show all the values):

``` r
brfss=brfss |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(data_value=as.double(data_value))
unique(brfss$response)
```

    ##  [1] "Excellent"                                 
    ##  [2] "Very good"                                 
    ##  [3] "Good"                                      
    ##  [4] "Fair"                                      
    ##  [5] "Poor"                                      
    ##  [6] "Good or Better Health"                     
    ##  [7] "Fair or Poor Health"                       
    ##  [8] "Yes"                                       
    ##  [9] "No"                                        
    ## [10] "Yes, pregnancy-related"                    
    ## [11] "No, pre-diabetes or borderline diabetes"   
    ## [12] "Smoke everyday"                            
    ## [13] "Smoke some days"                           
    ## [14] "Former smoker"                             
    ## [15] "Never smoked"                              
    ## [16] "Neither overweight nor obese (BMI le 24.9)"
    ## [17] "Overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9)"                
    ## [18] "Obese (BMI 30.0 - 99.8)"                   
    ## [19] "Checked in past 5 years"                   
    ## [20] "Not Checked in past 5 years"               
    ## [21] "Never Checked"                             
    ## [22] "Consume 5 or more times per day"           
    ## [23] "Consume less than 5 times per day"

The responses include “Excellent”, “Very Good”, “Good”, “Fair”, and
“Poor”.

Organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
“Excellent”:

``` r
brfss=brfss|>
  filter(topic=="Overall Health",response %in% c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"))|>
  mutate(
    response=factor(response, levels=c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"))
  )
```

Therefore, the order now is “Poor”, “Fair”, “Good”, “Very Good”, and
“Excellent”.

In 2002, states were observed at 7 or more locations

``` r
brfss |>
  filter(year==2002) |>
  group_by(locationabbr) |>
  summarize(n_stats = n_distinct(locationdesc)) |>
  filter(n_stats>=7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 2
    ##   locationabbr n_stats
    ##   <chr>          <int>
    ## 1 CT                 7
    ## 2 FL                 7
    ## 3 MA                 8
    ## 4 NC                 7
    ## 5 NJ                 8
    ## 6 PA                10

CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, and PA are states observed at 7 or more locations in
2002.

In 2010, states were observed at 7 or more locations

``` r
brfss |>
  filter(year==2010) |>
  group_by(locationabbr) |>
  summarize(n_stats = n_distinct(locationdesc)) |>
  filter(n_stats>=7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 14 × 2
    ##    locationabbr n_stats
    ##    <chr>          <int>
    ##  1 CA                12
    ##  2 CO                 7
    ##  3 FL                41
    ##  4 MA                 9
    ##  5 MD                12
    ##  6 NC                12
    ##  7 NE                10
    ##  8 NJ                19
    ##  9 NY                 9
    ## 10 OH                 8
    ## 11 PA                 7
    ## 12 SC                 7
    ## 13 TX                16
    ## 14 WA                10

CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, and WA are states
observed at 7 or more locations in 2010.

Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
across locations within a state.

``` r
dataone = brfss |>
  filter(response=="Excellent") |>
  group_by(year, locationabbr) |>
  summarize(data_value_mean=mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a state:

``` r
dataone |>
  rename("state"="locationabbr") |>
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=data_value_mean, color=state)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_tl3195_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />

The average data_value in excellent responses is between year of 2002 to
year of 2010. For most of the states, the range of the average
data_value for excellent responses is approximately between 17 and 28.

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.

``` r
two_panel=
  brfss |>
  filter(locationabbr=="NY"& year %in% c(2006,2010))|>
  ggplot(aes(x =response , y = data_value)) + 
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title = "Distribution of data_value in NY State in 2006 and 2010") +
  facet_grid(.~year)

two_panel
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_tl3195_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="90%" />

In both 2006 and 2010 distributions, the “Poor” responses have lowest
median value. Generally, the value of “Excellent” responses, “Very Good”
responses and “Good” resposnes have higher data values than “Poor” and
“Fair” responses in both 2006 and 2010. The “Very Good” responses in
2010 have larger variation and higher median value compared to those in
2006. The “Good” responses in 2010 have smaller variation lower median
compare to those in 2006. The “Fair” responses in 2010 have larger
variations compared to those in 2006.

# Problem 3 (Accelerometers)

Organize the demographic data: Include all originally observed
variables; Exclude participants less than 21 years of age, and those
with missing demographic data; Encode data with reasonable variable
classes (i.e. not numeric, and using factors with the ordering of tables
and plots in mind).

``` r
demographic=demographic|>
  drop_na()|>
  filter(age>=21)|>
  mutate(
     sex=case_match(
       sex,
       1~"male",
       2~"female"),
     education=case_match(
       education,
       1~"Less than high school",
       2~"High school equivalent",
       3~"More than high school"
     ),
     education=factor(education, levels=c(
       "Less than high school",
       "High school equivalent",
       "More than high school"))
  )
```

Organize accelerometer data:

``` r
accelerometer=accelerometer|>
  drop_na()|>
  pivot_longer(
    min1:min1440,
    names_to = "time",
    values_to = "mims_value"
  ) |>
  separate(time, into=c("min","minute"),3)|>
  select(-min)|>
  mutate(minute=as.integer(minute))
```
