# Problem 1 (Instacart)

Read in the dataset:

``` r
data("instacart")
instacart=instacart
```

Description of dataset: This dataset has 1384617 rows and 15 columns,
with each row resprenting a single product from an instacart order.
Variables include: `order_id`: order identifier `product_id`: product
identifier `add_to_cart_order`: the order in which each product was
added to the cart `reordered`: 1 if this prodcut has been ordered by
this user in the past, 0 otherwise `user_id`: customer identifier
`eval_set`: which evaluation set this order belongs in (Note that the
data for use in this class is exclusively from the “train” eval_set)
`order_number`: the order sequence number for this user (1=first, n=nth)
`order_dow`: the day of the week on which the order was placed
`order_hour_of_day`: the hour of the day on which the order was placed
`days_since_prior_order`: days since the last order, capped at 30, NA if
order_number=1 product_name: name of the product `aisle_id`: aisle
identifier `department_id`: department identifier `aisle`: the name of
the aisle `department`: the name of the department

The number of aisles and which aisles are the most items ordered from:

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n

    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

There are 134 aisles. The most item are ordered from fresh vegetables
aisles.

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  filter(n > 10000) |> 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()  
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week.

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

# Problem 2 (BRFSS)

Load the data data from the p8105.datasets package using:

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
brfss=brfss_smart2010
```

\*Data cleaning:

*format the data to use appropriate variable names; *focus on the
“Overall Health” topic *include only responses from “Excellent” to
“Poor” *organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor”
to “Excellent”

Specify response column (show all the values):

``` r
brfss=brfss |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(data_value=as.double(data_value))
unique(brfss$response)
```

    ##  [1] "Excellent"                                 
    ##  [2] "Very good"                                 
    ##  [3] "Good"                                      
    ##  [4] "Fair"                                      
    ##  [5] "Poor"                                      
    ##  [6] "Good or Better Health"                     
    ##  [7] "Fair or Poor Health"                       
    ##  [8] "Yes"                                       
    ##  [9] "No"                                        
    ## [10] "Yes, pregnancy-related"                    
    ## [11] "No, pre-diabetes or borderline diabetes"   
    ## [12] "Smoke everyday"                            
    ## [13] "Smoke some days"                           
    ## [14] "Former smoker"                             
    ## [15] "Never smoked"                              
    ## [16] "Neither overweight nor obese (BMI le 24.9)"
    ## [17] "Overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9)"                
    ## [18] "Obese (BMI 30.0 - 99.8)"                   
    ## [19] "Checked in past 5 years"                   
    ## [20] "Not Checked in past 5 years"               
    ## [21] "Never Checked"                             
    ## [22] "Consume 5 or more times per day"           
    ## [23] "Consume less than 5 times per day"

The responses include “Excellent”, “Very Good”, “Good”, “Fair”, and
“Poor”.

Organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
“Excellent”:

``` r
brfss=brfss |>
  filter(topic=="Overall Health",
    response %in% c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent")) |>
  mutate(response=factor(response, levels=c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent")))
```
